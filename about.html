        <p> My name is Ayush, and I am currently a 14-year-old with a passion for basketball and spending quality time with my friends. 
            I have embarked on this small business venture not only to earn some pocket money but also to make a meaningful impact on the lives 
            of children who are less fortunate. My aim is to support young kids who lack basic necessities such as clothing, toys, and education. 
            Through my efforts, I hope to provide them with the resources and opportunities they need to improve their quality of life and achieve
             their dreams. 
            By doing this, I aspire to create a positive difference in my community and inspire others to lend a helping hand to those in need. </p>
